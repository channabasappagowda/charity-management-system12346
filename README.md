**Project Description: Charity Management System**  The **Charity Management System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline and manage the operations of a charitable organization effectively. The primary objective of this system is to provide a centralized platform where donors, beneficiaries, and administrators can interact seamlessly to support social causes. The system allows users to register and log in with distinct roles such as Admin and User. Admins are responsible for managing donation records, verifying beneficiary requests, handling user data, and maintaining transparency in fund allocation. Users (donors or recipients) can sign up, log in, make donations, or request help based on their needs.  The system is developed using **PHP** as the backend language and **MySQL** as the database for storing user data, donations, requests, and other relevant records. The front end is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. Security measures such as form validations, session handling, and password checks are implemented to ensure data privacy and system integrity.  This system enhances the efficiency of charity processes by automating routine tasks, reducing paperwork, and making operations transparent and traceable. It serves as a reliable tool for both charitable organizations and donors, promoting trust, accountability, and easier engagement in humanitarian efforts. Overall, the Charity Management System acts as a digital bridge between generosity and need, helping to uplift underprivileged communities with technology-enabled support.
